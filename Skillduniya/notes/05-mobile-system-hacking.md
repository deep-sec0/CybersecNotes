# 05 - Mobile & System Hacking

## System Hacking

System Hacking is the phase where an attacker tries to gain access to individual systems and then maintain control over them.

### Stages:
- **Gaining Access**: Exploiting a vulnerability to enter the system.
- **Escalating Privileges**: Moving from a basic user to admin/root access.
- **Executing Applications**: Running malicious programs (like keyloggers, backdoors).
- **Hiding Files**: Concealing tools or payloads inside the system.
- **Covering Tracks**: Erasing logs or altering timestamps to avoid detection.

### Microsoft Authentication:
Windows systems store credentials in a file called **SAM (Security Account Manager)**.  
Attackers may target SAM files to extract password hashes for cracking.

## Mobile Hacking

Mobile devices can be targeted via malicious apps, phishing, or exploiting insecure permissions.

### Demo Tools:
- **Kali Linux**: The powerhouse OS for pentesting.
- **CamHacker**: A tool that uses a phishing link to access a mobile camera feed (used in test environments only).
