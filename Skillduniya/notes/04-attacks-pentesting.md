# Part 4: Phishing, Web Penetration & SQL Injection

## Phishing  
Phishing is a form of **social engineering**, where an attacker manipulates human behavior to gain access to confidential information. It usually involves tricking victims into giving away credentials or sensitive data.

### Types of Phishing  
- **Human-based:** Fake calls, messages, impersonation.  
- **Computer-based:** Spoofed emails, fake websites.  
- **Mobile-based:** Smishing (SMS phishing), malicious apps.

### Phishing Flow  
1. Attacker sets up a fake website that mimics a legit one.  
2. Victim receives a message or link leading to the phishing site.  
3. Victim enters credentials unknowingly.  
4. Attacker collects and misuses the info.

### Creation Methods  
- **Manual:**  
  - Clone login page (HTML).  
  - Use a PHP script to grab credentials.  
  - Store them in a `.txt` file.  
- **Automatic:**  
  - Tool: **Zphisher** (in Kali Linux). Automates phishing setups.

## Website Penetration Testing  
Basic understanding of how websites work helps in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Website Architecture  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP, Python, etc.  
- **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

### How It Works  
User request → Server processes → Database interaction → Response displayed

### Common Threats  
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
- **Authentication Bypass**  
- **Broken Access Control**

## SQL Injection (SQLi)  
SQL Injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. It happens when user inputs are not properly validated, giving attackers the chance to inject malicious SQL code.

### Common SQL Commands Used  
Here are some basic SQL commands often used in SQLi:
- `SELECT` – retrieves data  
- `INSERT` – adds data  
- `UPDATE` – modifies data  
- `DELETE` – removes data  
- `DROP` – deletes tables/databases

These commands can be weaponized to bypass authentication, extract sensitive info, or tamper with data.

### Demo  
A demo of SQL Injection was performed on `testphp.vulnweb.com`.  
Detailed steps and payloads are documented in the **Mini Projects** section.
