# 06 - Cryptography & Steganography

## Steganography

Steganography is the art of hiding data **in plain sight**â€”concealing information within other non-suspicious files.

### Common Types:
- **Image Steganography**: Hide text or files inside images.
- **Video Steganography**: Embed data into video frames.
- **Whitespace Steganography**: Use invisible characters (spaces, tabs) to encode information.

### Tools Used:
- **QuickStego**: GUI tool (downloaded from an online source) to hide/reveal messages inside images.
- **Manual Method**: Command-line based techniques using Linux terminal for basic hiding and extraction.

## Cryptography

Cryptography is the process of securing information through **encryption**â€”transforming data so it can only be accessed by intended parties.

### Why itâ€™s used:
- Confidentiality: Hide the real content.
- Integrity: Ensure it hasnâ€™t been tampered with.
- Authentication: Verify the sender/receiver.

### Common Algorithms:
- **MD5 / SHA**: Hashing algorithms, used for integrity checks.
- **RSA**: Public-key encryption system (widely used in secure communications).

### Practice Platforms:
- Explored via various **online websites** for demo and hashing practice (e.g., md5hashing.net, cryptii.com).
