# Part 1: Ethical Hacking Fundamentals

## What I Learned

* **What is Hacking?**
  Hacker try to steal the info from the system , he is unauthorized . To get this info by taking unauthorized control over that system using different tools & techniques .

* **Information Security**
  practice of protecting info from unauthorized access, usage, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, copying, or destruction.

* **Types of Hackers**

  * *White Hat*: Ethical hackers who test systems legally.
  * *Black Hat*: Malicious hackers exploiting systems.
  * *Grey Hat*: A mix; sometimes legal, sometimes not.

* **Phases of Hacking**

  * *Footprinting* (reconnaissance)
  * *Scanning*
  * *Gaining Access*
  * *Maintaining Access*
  * *Privilege Escalation*

* **Key Terminology**

  1. **Vulnerability** — Weakness in a system that can be exploited.
  2. **Payload** — The actual code or action an exploit delivers.
  3. **Exploit** — The trick or technique used to attack a vulnerability.
  4. **Zero-day Attack** — A fresh exploit no one knows about yet.
  5. **Daisy Chaining** — Linking multiple exploits or attacks to gain deeper access.

* **Elements of Information Security**

  1. **Confidentiality** — Keeping info secret, only for the eyes that need it.
  2. **Integrity** — Making sure data isn’t messed with or altered without permission.
  3. **Availability** — Ensuring systems and data are up and running when needed.
  4. **Authenticity** — Confirming the identity of users and systems — no fakes allowed.

This foundational knowledge builds the framework for my ethical hacking journey and sets the stage for hands-on tool use and attack simulations.
