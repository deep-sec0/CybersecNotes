# Personal Projects

This folder contains cybersecurity-related ideas, concepts, tools, and techniques that I’ve explored outside of formal platforms like TryHackMe or internship-based work (Skillduniya).

Some of these are self-developed thoughts, others are deep dives into tools or patterns I find interesting — all documented in my own style.

## What's Inside

- **Digital Stalking (DS):**  
  A concept that blends footprinting, psychological observation, and behavior analysis in digital spaces. Built from personal insight, not textbooks.

- **[More coming soon]**  
  Topics may include unusual OSINT workflows, manipulation patterns, raw tool observations, and things I break just to understand.

## Why This Exists

Most learning happens between the lines.  
This folder is for the experiments, half-mad ideas, “what-if” thoughts, and personal research that doesn’t always fit into courses or structured labs.

> Think of it as the space between curiosity and chaos — where real learning happens.
